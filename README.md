### ✨Hi there✨ 👋


**JDgoldvox/JDgoldvox** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal game that I'm making called Orbital Horizon - A space game that plays like a mix between Terraria, Corekeeper and Stardew Valley: [link](https://github.com/JDgoldvox/ProjectEXP). I'm also still a student about to graduate in the summer of 2025! I'm also working on my final honours project about Behaviour Trees and Genetic Algorithms [link](https://github.com/JDgoldvox/WangYuGrundyHonoursProject).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, C#, C++, Rust, HTML, CSS and JS! I'm also keenly interested in learning real-life languages, like Chinese🌏, Mexican-Spanish🧭 and French🐌!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting connections in the Game industry.
- 💬 Ask me what my favourite games are and what I like so much about the community built around them.
- 📫 links provided in website: [website](https://jdgoldvox.com/#Contact-Details)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had no prior experience in coding before university, so I really did jump head in!
