### ✨Hi there✨ 👋

## ❤️I'm Wang Grundy!❤️

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal game that I'm making called Orbital Horizon - A space game that plays like a mix between Terraria, Corekeeper and Stardew Valley: [link](https://github.com/JDgoldvox/ProjectEXP). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, C#, C++, Rust, HTML, CSS and JS! I'm also keenly interested in learning real-life languages, like Chinese🌏, Mexican-Spanish🧭 and French🐌!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting connections in the Game industry.
- 💬 Ask me what my favourite games are and what I like so much about the community built around them.
- 📫 links provided in website: [website](https://jdgoldvox.com/#Contact-Details)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had no prior experience in coding before university, so I really did jump head in!
